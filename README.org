#+title: psci-mode
#+author: ardumont

* What

Major mode for [[http://www.purescript.org/][purescript]]'s repl psci.

* How

Based on comint.
Following this tutorial http://www.masteringemacs.org/article/comint-writing-command-interpreter.

* Why

The [[https://github.com/dysinger/purescript-mode][purescript-mode]] (forked from [[https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode][haskell-mode]]) does not provide any repl integration (yet?).
The experience inside the terminal is somewhat tedious at the moment.
So I thought of giving it a shot.

* When

How about now?

* Who

me!
