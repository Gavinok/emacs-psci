#+title: psci-mode
#+author: ardumont

* Description
** What

Major mode for [[http://www.purescript.org/][purescript]]'s repl psci.

** How

Based on comint.
Following this tutorial http://www.masteringemacs.org/article/comint-writing-command-interpreter.

** Why

The [[https://github.com/dysinger/purescript-mode][purescript-mode]] (forked from [[https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode][haskell-mode]]) does not provide any repl integration (yet?).
The experience inside the terminal is somewhat tedious at the moment.
So I thought of giving it a shot.

** When

How about now?

** Who

* Install

As soon as something is working, I intend to release on melpa/melpa-stable/marmalade.

For the moment, clone the repository, add to load-path and eval the buffer psci.el.
